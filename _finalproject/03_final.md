2. Create a rough draft for your final report on google docs and include the following:
   1. Cover page - project name; team members names, year, email; page numbers
   2. Introduction -  project goal & overview; what is the big picture/impact 
   3. Base Analysis - answers to at least 3-4 of the key questions
   4. Extension Analysis - overview of the teamâ€™s extension idea and why they chose it; answers to 2-3 key questions
   5. Attempt to answer as many overarching project questions as possible (should have at least 4 answered)
3. All visualizations must be labeled properly (x-axis, y-axis,) and have a description below the figure explaining what it means. 
4. Team members must indicate in the report where they contributed work. 
5. Submit draft to Google Drive and Gradescope.
6. Submit all of the following information (code, notebooks, answers to questions) as a PR to your team's branch on GitHub. (Add your TPM and TA as reviewers!)
