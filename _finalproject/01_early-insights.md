Sufficient data should have been collected to perform a preliminary analysis of the data and attempt to answer one question relevant to your project proposal which you will submit as a pull request. 

*If data has already been collected for your project you must answer two questions.*

1. Collect and pre-process (e.g. data cleaning, data transformation) a preliminary batch of data
2. Perform a preliminary analysis of the data. [Here](https://buspark.io/documentation/project-guides/eda_final) is a guide to help you get started.
3. What questions can and can't be answered with the data you have. What other data do you need and how will you get access to it?
4. Submit all of the following information (code, notebooks, answers to questions) as a PR to your team's branch on GitHub. (Add your TPM and TA as reviewers!)
