This assignment is released as a Python Notebook [at this link](assignment1.ipynb). Please read the instructions there and complete the parts marked `TODO`.
**This assignment involves a data collection step that contains action items as early as Monday. So please start early.**

You can use Google Colab to edit the Python notebook or run your local Jupyter server.

Once the Python notebook is completed, follow these steps to submit:

  1. Create a private repo called `assignment-1` following the repo naming convention.
  2. Add the completed `assignment1.ipynb` to the repo (it can be the only file).
  3. Make the `assignment-1` repo public on the deadline.
