# GIT Instructions

## 1. Set Up Your GitHub Repository:
- Create a new repository on GitHub named `username.github.io`, where `username` is your GitHub username.
- This repository will host your personal website.

## 2. Design Your Website:
- Create a simple HTML/CSS website. You can use any website template you like or build your own from scratch.
- Ensure that your website includes the following sections:
  - **About Me**: A brief introduction about yourself.
  - **Work Experience**: If any, highlight your work experience.
  - **Projects**: A section showcasing some of the projects you've worked on.
  - **Contact**: Information on how to reach you, like email, LinkedIn, etc.
  - Each section should be a separate page. Don't include multiple sections in same page, create different dedicated pages for different sections.

## 3. Create an Assignment Section:
- Create a page for an **Assignment** section where you will put all your course assignments.
- For each assignment, you will provide a brief explanation of how you approached it.
- You will include a link to the GitHub code repository of that assignment.
- Below is an example image of how your assignment page in your portfolio website might look like (Styling is not necessary, you can choose to keep minimal styling):

## 4. Conventions and Rules:
Don't forget to follow the given rules:
- The href/link to your assignment's github code repo should be named : "Github Link". This is a strict naming convention, and should be followed.
- Name of the pages should be: "About Me", "Work Experience", "Projects", "Contact", and "Assignments".
- Keep your GitHub code repository private until the assignment deadline, then switch it to public so the graders can access and grade your assignment.
- The name of your github code repository should be of the format: "assignment-X" (where X is the assignment number), for example: "assignment-1".
- If the above convention rules are not followed as specified, then we will not be able to grade and you will get a 0.

## 5. Demo Assignment:
- For the purpose of proof checking your website and grading, submit the following assignment task in your assignment section of your github portfolio website along with the github repo link for this assignment:
    Assignment 0 task: Write a program in python to add two numbers and return their sum.

## 6. Deploy Your Website:
- Push your website files to the main branch of your `username.github.io` repository.
- GitHub will automatically deploy your website to `https://username.github.io/`.
- Test your website to ensure itâ€™s live and functioning as expected.

## 7. Submit to the Course Repository:
- Create a pull request against the course repository with a link to your website.
