## Spark! Project Work Syllabus

Teams are expected to complete deliverables on their set due dates. If a team needs more time on a deliverable this must be communicated to the PM at least two days prior to the due date. The PM will alert the instructor and will communicate the extension time to the team.

If students are going to drop the class, they need to inform their PM, TE, and the Spark! Operations Director (Lydia Holck - lydia12@bu.edu).
