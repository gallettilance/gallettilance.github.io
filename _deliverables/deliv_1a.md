title: Checkpoint A - Rough Draft of Early Insights Presentation
---

The team should have collected more data/processed more data and continued to perform a more thorough analysis. You will present your findings to the client at the Early Insights Meeting. 
This is a checkpoint to make sure you are prepared. 

Because there are two distinct project styles (city council vs client based), the requirements are slightly different in the content that needs to be included:

If you are assigned to a **client based project**, you will need to prepare the following:
- [ ] Create a draft presentation using this template [Presentation Outlines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MpOHudOloqKpt5S81rGyYuurps9CeDJ7XlUi000L1cM/edit?usp=sharing)
- [ ] Answer at least two more key questions since Deliverable 1
- [ ] You will need to include:
    - [ ] Any additional challenges you have encountered?
    - [ ] What limitations have you encountered? 
    - [ ] What assumptions have you had to make?
    - [ ] What were the expected next steps, and did you follow them or did the scope change? 
    - [ ] What are you planning to do to complete your project?

If you are assigned to a **city council project**, you will need to prepare the following:
- The Base Project includes a rigid, set scope with a clear end deliverable. The questions to be answered, wanted visualizations and visualization answers, are clearly outlined for the student to complete. 
    - [ ] Create a draft presentation using this template [Presentation Outlines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MpOHudOloqKpt5S81rGyYuurps9CeDJ7XlUi000L1cM/edit?usp=sharing) you will present the findings from the Base Project.
    - [ ] Answer all the key questions on your project document.
- The end of the presentation must include the teamâ€™s Extension Project. This is the opportunity for students to be creative with additional data sets and sources that they believe will tell an interesting story. 
    - [ ] The team should utilize this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EFkQJpOBXHbsJj7LdFNFHaMBzaAt69HARnmcam-slpU/edit?usp=sharing) for their proposal and incorporate it into their presentation. This will be pitched directly to the client, and they will have to sign off on the idea.
